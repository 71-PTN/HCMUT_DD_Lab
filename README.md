# My codes for the whole EE2420 course
My attempts at all assignments from HCMUT's Digital Design Laboratory course (EE2420) this year (K20). Note that I did some of them *in my own way*, which means I didn't do exactly as required, but still managed to output the final, expected results.

Below is the list of all assignments. Credit goes to Department of Electronics, Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.

I recommend you try them yourself first before looking at my solutions, since they are not very clean :P

(That being said, I might try to add comments and provide explanation to all of my codes later. Hope I won't be too lazy.)
